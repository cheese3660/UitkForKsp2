[Documentation](https://docs.spacewarp.org)

Space Warp is a modding API for Kerbal Space Program 2 with support for BepInEx and the official mod loader.*

*\*Note: The official mod loader is unfinished, so BepInEx is currently still required to enable it.*

## Installation

**It is highly recommended to use CKAN [Download Here](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN) to install Space Warp**

If you for some reason want to manually install it, here are the instructions:

Note: *Don't worry about the BepInEx installation, it already comes in the zip folder!*

Download the latest release of [UITK for KSP 2](https://github.com/jan-bures/UitkForKsp2/releases).

Drag the contents of UitkForKsp2's .zip file into your KSP2 directory, commonly located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2`.

Download the latest Space Warp release from this page under the [Releases](https://github.com/SpaceWarpDev/SpaceWarp/releases) section above.

Drag the contents of Space Warp's .zip file into your KSP2 directory, commonly located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2`.

In the case of installing on Linux under Wine/Proton, you need to override winhttp DLL in winecfg, as described [in BepInEx documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html).

To install the downloaded mods, simply drag them into the plugins folder location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2\BepInEx\plugins`.
Remember that mods don't go into the SpaceWarp plugin folder, they go along side with it in the `BepInEx\plugins` folder.

That should be it, you can now launch the game and enjoy!

## Compiling

To compile this project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install .NET 7+ SDK
2. Run `dotnet restore` inside the top directory to install the packages.
3. Run `dotnet build -c <Configuration>` to build the project, where `<Configuration>` is one of the following:
    - `Debug` - Builds the project in debug mode
    - `Deploy` - Builds the project in debug mode and copies the output to the KSP2 directory
    - `DeployAndRun` - Builds the project in debug mode, copies the output to the KSP2 directory, and runs the game
    - `Release` - Builds the project in release mode, zips the output, and builds a NuGet package

or you can use Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider to build the project.

There are also scripts in the `scripts` folder that can be used to build the project in each of the configurations, they simply run the `dotnet build` command with the correct arguments.

The outputs can be found in `dist/<Configuration>`. The Release zip will be in the `dist` folder, and the NuGet package will be in the `nuget` folder.

## Mod Structure
